# Colvert Contributor Code of Conduct

## Scope

_Colvert Contributor Code of Conduct_ applies:
* within all **Colvert** collaborative spaces, which include community communication channels as mailing lists, issue tracker, submitted pull requests, commit comments, discussions, etc.;
* in public spaces when an individual is officially representing the project.

## Our Pledge

Contributing to a open source software project also means contributing to the work of others. It is requiring mutual respect. It may also lead to communication issues and unhappiness.

Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others.

As maintainers and contributors of this project, we pledge to respect some obvious common sense conduct guidelines for a respectful, productive, and collaborative place:
* Participants will be tolerant and respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
* Participants must ensure that their language and actions are free of personal attacks and disparaging personal remarks. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.
* When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should obviously always assume good intentions.
* Publishing (or threatening to publish) other people’s private information ("doxing"), such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission is prohibited.
* Posting inapropriate material (violent, sexual, etc.) is obviously prohibited.
* Harassment-free, respectful and professional conduct must be an obvious way of acting. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners.

It's a normal behaviour to disagree. When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively as we are capable of having adult discussions. We’re are unique individuals from a wide range of backgrounds, and people may have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that error is human and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

Anyone's contribution is accepted. No matter who contributors are or where they are from, only contribution counts. Nothing else matters. If it helps to go ahead with enhancements on **Colvert** project, we will gladly accept it.

## Enforcement

Behaviour which could be reasonably considered as harassment or unprofessional conduct will not be tolerated. In case of unrespectful acts, project maintainers have all reserved rights to moderate contributions and to take any required and appropriate actions in the interest of the project, but are also under no obligation to do so and we do not warranty implying that action will be taken.

Any report, if you estimate it as necessary, can be done by contacting project maintainers at contact@colvert.io. Project maintainers will obviously maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter.

This is a open source software project, the purpose of it is to write a working software. Depending the way you may bring an issue to our attention, we might moderate the issue, but we're not going to automatically reject the idea or the pull request because it came from somebody who is not behaving properly. Contributions to the project will be judged only on the merit of those contributions themselves.

Project maintainers will be final judges of any last decision on contributions, in the interest of the **Colvert** project.

It is still free for anyone to fork the project.
