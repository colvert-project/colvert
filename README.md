**Colvert** is a tool designed to manage your portfolio of _detection use cases_ through their entire lifecycle in the context of **Information Security Event Management**.

## About

### Purpose

**Colvert** manage the portfolio of _detection use cases_ with the possibility to document and follow-up use cases development, improvement and implementation; testing status; risk coverage compared to well-known security threats based on multiple contextual data sources; related preventive controls; and instructions for analysts triage, qualification, and correlation as playbooks and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).
It is designed to be used in the context of the _Service Area_ **Information Security Event Management** / _Service_ **Monitoring and Detection** / _Function_ **Detection Use Case Management** as defined in the [CSIRT Services Framework Version 2.1](https://www.first.org/standards/frameworks/csirts/csirt_services_framework_v2.1) from the [FIRST](https://www.first.org):

> _**Purpose:**_ Manage the portfolio of detection use cases through their entire lifecycle.
> 
> _**Description:**_ New detection approaches are developed, tested, and improved, and eventually onboarded into a detection use case in production. Instructions for analyst triage, qualification, and correlation need to be developed, for example in the form of playbooks and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Use cases that do not perform well, i.e., that have an unfavorable benefit/effort ratio, need to be improved, redefined, or abandoned. The portfolio of detection use cases should be expanded in a risk-oriented way and in coordination with preventive controls.
> 
> _**Outcome:**_ A portfolio of effective detection use cases that are relevant to the constituency is developed.
