**Colvert** is a tool made for cybersecurity teams (CSIRTs / SOCs) and designed to manage their portfolio of _detection use cases_ through their entire lifecycle in the context of **Information Security Event Management**.

The tool consists of:

* _TODO_ - The main application
* _TODO_ - Connectors to potentially get data from providers and more-valued information.
